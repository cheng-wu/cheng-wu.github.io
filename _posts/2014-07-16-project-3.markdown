description: In my free time, I like to play guitar. I was formerly in Going 2 Ohio, a Chinese alternative music band. My favorite types of music are post-hardcore, trance core, and electronic core. Some of my favorite bands are Multi-Ego, Asking Alexandria, Escape the Fate, Bring Me the Horizon, A Day to Remember, Pierce the Veil, Chunk No Captain Chunk, and Alesana. See you at the show!
