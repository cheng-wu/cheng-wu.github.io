description: I lick rock music. To be more specific, I like post-hardcore, easy core, trance core, electric core, etc. I used to be guitarist in Going 2 Ohio, a Chinese alternative music band. Anyway, here is the list of bands that I love, multi-ego, asking alexandria, escape the fate, bring me the horizon, a day to remember, pierce the vail, chunk no captain chunk, alesana, etc. See you in Rock live!
